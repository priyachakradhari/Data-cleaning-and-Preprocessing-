# Data-cleaning-and-Preprocessing-
This project involves cleaning and preparing the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset for further analysis. The dataset contains information about content available on Netflix, including title, type, director, cast, country, date added, release year, rating, duration, genres, and description.

✅ Key Steps Performed:
Handled missing values in columns like director, cast, and country using placeholder values such as 'Unknown'.

Converted the date_added column to proper datetime format.

Removed duplicate records to ensure data quality.

Verified and corrected data types for consistency.

Ensured column names were clean and uniform.

Documented all data cleaning steps clearly for transparency.

This cleaned dataset is now ready for exploratory data analysis, visualizations, and further insights into Netflix’s content distribution and trends.
